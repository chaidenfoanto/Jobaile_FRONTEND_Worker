Jobaile is a mobile and web-based recruitment platform designed to connect recruiters with domestic workers such as housemaids (ART), caregivers, cleaners, and other household service providers.

The application was developed to help address trust issues that are still common in domestic worker recruitment processes. Many employers experience difficulties in finding reliable workers, while workers also struggle to access secure and trustworthy job opportunities.

Jobaile provides a digital platform that simplifies the recruitment process through user verification, worker profiles, communication features, and job matching systems.

The system consists of two main roles:

### Recruiter
Recruiters or employers can:

- Search for domestic workers
- View worker profiles and information
- Monitor application status
- Communicate with workers
- Find workers that match their requirements

### Worker
Workers can:

- Create professional profiles
- Apply for available jobs
- Showcase skills and experiences
- Receive job opportunities from recruiters
- Build credibility through profile information

Main features include:

- Domestic worker recruitment platform
- Recruiter and worker role management
- Real-time communication features
- Profile and identity management
- Job searching and matching system
- Mobile-friendly user experience
- Secure authentication system
